# About

My goal is to build all necessary notification channels for securing "Termin" appointments across all cities in Germany, making the process easier and less stressful.

If your city or certain types of "Termin" aren't listed, feel free to contact me at [n9102125@gmail.com](mailto:n9102125@gmail.com) or open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/noworneverev/germany-termin-bot). Please include the city name, the official "Termin" website and the types of appointments. If time allows, I will do my best to add support for your request.

Lastly, fuck the German Termin system.
