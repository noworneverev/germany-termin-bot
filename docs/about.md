# About

My goal is to build all necessary notification channels for securing "Termin" appointments across all cities in Germany, making the process easier and less stressful.

If your city isn't listed, feel free to contact me at [n9102125@gmail.com](mailto:n9102125@gmail.com) or open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/noworneverev/germany-termin-bot). Please include the city name and the official "Termin" website. If time allows, I'll do my best to create a channel for your city.

In short, fuck the German Termin system.
